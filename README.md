# Phenome 2020 Digital Phenotyping Workshop

Phenome 2020 Digital Phenotyping workshop materials. 


The Phenome 2020 Digital Phenotyping Workshop gave participants hands-on experience processing data from state-of-the-art image-based phenotyping technologies with domain experts. Topics covered included: Image processing of 2D images, hyperspectral image processing, and machine learning.

## Session Topics

### Session 1: Image Analysis using PlantCV

In this hands-on section we will use open-source open development image analysis software, [PlantCV](http://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/), to segment and extract trait data from visible (RGB) images.

Instructors: Haley Schuhl, Malia Gehan, and Noah Fahlgren (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)

### Session 2: Deep Learning using Deep Plant Phenomics

This hands-on section will guide participants through training a deep convolutional neural network for counting wheat heads in aerial field images using the [Deep Plant Phenomics]() software.

Instructor: Jordan Ubbens (University of Saskatchewan)

### Session 3: Hyperspectral Image Analysis

This hands-on section will explore techniques and algorithms used in hyperspectral image analysis including spectral unmixing, target detection, and classification methods using tools developed by the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://github.com/GatorSense/) at the University of Florida.

Instructors: Alina Zare, Susan Meerdink (University of Florida)
