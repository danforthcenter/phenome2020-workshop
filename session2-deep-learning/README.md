# Session 2: Deep Learning using Deep Plant Phenomics

## Pre-workshop: Setup environment

Prior to the workshop we set up environments for each participant using Amazon Web Services EC2 p3.2xlarge compute instances with NVIDIA V100 GPU compute modules. 

To replicate the software environment for session 2:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Install Deep Plant Phenomics:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

Alternatively, follow the instructions at https://github.com/p2irc/deepplantphenomics.
