# Session 3: Hyperspectral Image Analysis

The hyperspectral image analysis secion covered four topics:

1. Introduction to hyperspectral images and analysis.
2. Hyperspectral unmixing: decomposing a hyperspectral image into the pure spectral sigatures found in the scene.
3. Hyperspectral target detection: determining whether a particular target signature is found in each pixel of an image.
4. Hyperspectral classification: classify each pixel into one of a set of groups.
